## Details and construction of Emoji Match memory game:

This memory testing card flipping game was created purely for fun and to test my knowledge of Java script functions and for loops.

## project mission:
---

To make a simple memory game where you need to match two identical cards and keep going until you reveal all the cards but you only have 6 lives. I'ts more difficult than you may first think.

## User stories:
----

- As a first time user I would like to play a quick and easy game to pass the time.

- As a first time user I would like to play a game without needing to read instructions.

- As a returning user I want to reveal all the cards with more remaining lives than the last time eventually trying to complete the perfect 6 remaining.
